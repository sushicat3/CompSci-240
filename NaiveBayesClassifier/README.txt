This NBC program generates 6 text files each of which which indicates the MAP and posteriori probabilities for each city in the 50-line test files and provides a percentage of accuracy.

The provided text files are also submitted with the code, and they are the same as what is posted online with the experiment. 

The output text files generated by the program are provided in the folder "output" but you can also generate them yourself when you run the program 

The program is in C++ so you can compile it with g++ and then ./a.out on edlab. You can view the files with cat or download them.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:

	Important Functions:

	- hasLetFcn (has-letter function)
			this function updates the global array hasLet and is used to keep track of the letters that are contained in a city name taken from the input file. the hasLet array is then added to the likelihood one (llh) to keep track of how many times a particular letter is observed in that city type
		- clrHasLet (clear has-letter array)
			this clears hasLet array for next use
	
	- llhFcn (likelihood function)
			this function does the actual reading of the training data files and calls on hasLetFcn to update the llh array of each type of city. the actual likelihood probabilities are caclulated in pstrFcn and are used to get the posteriori numerator
		- initLlh (initialize likelihood)
			the 3 llh arrays (one for each city) are given initial values of 1 so that there are no multiply-by-zero problems as explained in the discussion
		- incLlh (increment likelihood)
			this is where the hasLet array is added to the llh array
	
	- pstrFcn (posteriori function)
			this doesn't actually get the whole posteriori probability, but the numerator part. The actual probability with numerator/denominator is calculated in genMAP
	
	- genMAP (generate MAP hypothesis)
			this function generates the output, it uses hasLetFcn to keep track of the letters in the city read from the test file, and then calculates the MAP and posterioris. It also keeps track of the number of accurate MAP's and adds a percentage of accuracy to the output text files.
